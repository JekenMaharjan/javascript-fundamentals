# JavaScript Exam – Intermediate Level (Exam 2)

This folder contains **Intermediate Level – Exam 2** of the JavaScript Exam series.

This exam focuses on **arrays, objects, and commonly used methods**, which are essential for writing clean logic, working with data structures, and preparing for real-world JavaScript applications.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Intermediate  
- **Exam No**: 02  
- **Topic**: Arrays, Objects & Methods  

This exam strengthens understanding of **array transformations, object manipulation, destructuring, and method usage**, which are heavily tested in interviews and daily development work.

---

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

The following concepts are covered in this exam:

1. Arrays vs Objects  
2. Common array methods (`push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
3. Difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`  
4. `forEach()` vs `map()`  
5. Array and object destructuring  
6. Object methods  
7. `this` keyword in object context  
8. Shallow copy vs deep copy

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains key JavaScript concepts in a simple and exam-oriented manner, including:

- What arrays and objects are and when to use them
- Important array methods with clear explanations
- Differences between map(), filter(), and reduce()
- Purpose of forEach() and why it does not return data
- Destructuring syntax for arrays and objects
- Defining methods inside objects
- Proper understanding of the this keyword
- Shallow copy vs deep copy concepts

This section focuses on clarity, correctness, and interview readiness.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file contains practical problems that test real usage of arrays and objects, such as:

- Transforming arrays using map()
- Filtering data using filter()
- Calculating totals using reduce()
- Extracting values from arrays of objects
- Creating and using object methods
- Using destructuring correctly
- Creating shallow copies of arrays
- Fixing common bugs related to arrow functions and this

⚠️ *Console output is avoided unless explicitly required, encouraging pure function logic.*

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Master array transformation techniques
- Understand object structure and behavior
- Write predictable and reusable logic
- Avoid common mistakes with `this`
- Prepare for frontend and backend JavaScript interviews

> Arrays and objects are the backbone of JavaScript.
> Mastering them makes everything else easier.
