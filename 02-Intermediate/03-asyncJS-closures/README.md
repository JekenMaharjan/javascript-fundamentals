# JavaScript Exam – Intermediate Level (Exam 3)

This folder contains **Intermediate Level – Exam 3** of the JavaScript Exam series.

This exam focuses on **Asynchronous JavaScript and Closures**, two core concepts that explain *how JavaScript actually works behind the scenes* and are frequently tested in interviews.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Intermediate  
- **Exam No**: 03  
- **Topic**: Asynchronous JavaScript & Closures  

This exam builds a strong understanding of **non-blocking behavior, promises, async/await, closures, and the event loop**.

---

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

The following topics are covered in this exam:

1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript  
2. Callback functions and callback hell  
3. Promises and Promise states  
4. `async` and `await`  
5. Error handling in asynchronous code  
6. Closures and lexical scope  
7. Use cases of closures  
8. JavaScript event loop (basic idea)

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The **theory.md** file explains asynchronous behavior and closures in simple, clear, and exam-oriented language, covering:

- Difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution
- Why callbacks are used and their drawbacks
- What Promises are and how their states work
- Why `async/await` is preferred over `.then()`
- Concept of closures with real-world analogy
- Practical use cases of closures
- Basic working of the JavaScript event loop
- Importance of error handling in async code

This section focuses on **conceptual clarity**, which is critical for interviews and debugging real-world applications.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The **test.js** file includes hands-on problems such as:

- Passing and executing callback functions
- Creating and consuming Promises
- Using .then() and async/await
- Handling Promise rejection using try/catch
- Creating closures to maintain state
- Fixing common closure bugs caused by var
- Understanding block scope using let

All examples are written in **plain JavaScript**, without frameworks or libraries.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## ✅ Exam Status

- ✔ Theory completed
- ✔ Practical completed
- ✔ Async logic tested
- ✔ Closure bugs fixed
- ✔ Ready for review

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations
- Write clean and readable async code
- Avoid callback hell
- Use `async/await` confidently
- Master closures and lexical scope
- Debug common async and closure-related issues

> If you understand async and closures,
> JavaScript stops feeling “magical” and starts feeling logical.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Move to Intermediate Exam 4
- Practice real async scenarios (API calls, timers)
- Combine closures with async logic
- Prepare for interview questions on the event loop

📌 *This exam is part of a structured JavaScript learning roadmap, progressing from core logic to real-world asynchronous programming.*
