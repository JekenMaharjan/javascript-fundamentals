## 📝 Part A – Theory

The **theory.md** file contains detailed explanations of:

- Scope and hoisting differences between var, let, and const
- Function expressions vs function declarations
- Arrow functions with advantages and limitations
- Primitive and non-primitive data types
- Pass by value vs pass by reference with examples
- Purpose and behavior of the return keyword
- Callback functions and why they are used
- Default parameters in functions

This section focuses on **conceptual depth**, which is crucial for interviews and debugging real-world applications.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The **test.js** file includes practical JavaScript problems such as:

- Writing functions that return calculated values
- Checking even or odd numbers using clean logic
- Converting normal functions into arrow functions
- Working with arrays and loops inside functions
- Finding the largest number in an array
- Using callback functions correctly
- Identifying and fixing logical bugs

⚠️ *Unless explicitly mentioned, console output is avoided to test pure logic.*

All solutions are written in **plain JavaScript**, without using any frameworks or external libraries.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Goal

The goal of this exam is to:

- Write clean and predictable functions
- Understand how JavaScript handles data and memory
- Use callbacks and parameters effectively
- Strengthen logical thinking
- Prepare for real-world coding and interviews

> Strong logic separates average developers from dependable ones.
