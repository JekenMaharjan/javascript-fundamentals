## 📝 Part A – Theory

The **theory.md** file contains written explanations covering:

- What control flow means in JavaScript
- Difference between if-else and switch
- When to use for loop vs while loop
- Logical operators (&&, ||) with examples
- What happens when no condition matches

This section ensures **logical clarity before writing code**.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The **test.js** file includes hands-on JavaScript problems such as:

- Checking whether a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Creating a grade system using else-if
- Finding day names using switch
- Printing numbers using for loop
- Printing even numbers using while loop
- Login validation using logical operators

All programs are written in **plain JavaScript**, without using any framework.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open **Developer Tools → Console**
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js
