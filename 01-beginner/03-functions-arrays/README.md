## 📝 Part A – Theory

The **theory.md** file contains clear explanations of:

- What a function is and why it is used
- Difference between function declaration and function expression
- Parameters and return values
- What arrays are and why they are useful
- Difference between array length and index
- Common array methods:
  - `push()`
  - `pop()`
  - `shift()`
  - `unshift()`
- Simple examples for each concept

This section focuses on **concept clarity**, which is essential for interviews and real-world coding.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The **test.js** file includes hands-on JavaScript problems such as:

- Writing a function to calculate the sum of two numbers
- Checking whether a number is even or odd using a function
- Creating an array and accessing elements using index
- Looping through an array using a `for` loop
- Using basic array methods (`push`, `pop`)
- Solving a problem using **function + array logic** to find the largest number

All programs are written in **plain JavaScript**, without using any frameworks or libraries.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Goal

The goal of this exam is to:

- Understand functions for reusability
- Work confidently with arrays
- Combine logic using functions + arrays
- Build a strong foundation for React and backend development

> Strong fundamentals today prevent confusion tomorrow.
