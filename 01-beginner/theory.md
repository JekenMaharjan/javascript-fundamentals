## Topic: JavaScript Basics (Very Important Foundations)

## Syllabus
-> This test checks:
    1. Variables (var, let, const)
    2. Data types
    3. Operators
    4. console.log
    5. Simple conditions

## PART A – THEORY

Q1. What is JavaScript? Where does it run?
-> JavaScript is programming language which is used for interactive components in building web applications like error handling in forms, display on console of web browser, etc.
-> It runs on web browser.

Q2. Difference between var, let, and const
-> 'var' means variable whose value can be changed.
-> 'let' means similar to the variable.
-> 'const' means constant whose value is most likely always same.

Q3. What are primitive data types in JavaScript?
-> Primitive datatypes in JavaScript are:
    1. string
    2. integer/number
    3. character (char)
    4. boolean

Q4. What does console.log() do and why is it important?
-> It shows the output display(print) on the console of the web browser.
-> It important because it help us test if the program in Javascript it working well or not and also helps in debugging.

Q5. Difference between == and ===
-> '==' means that is equal to this i.e. a = b without checking its datatypes whereas '===' is similar to '==' but checks its datatypes properly.
