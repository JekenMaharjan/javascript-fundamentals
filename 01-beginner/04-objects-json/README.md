## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file contains clear explanations of:

- What an object is in JavaScript
- Understanding key–value pairs
- Accessing object properties using dot and bracket notation
- Updating existing properties and adding new properties
- Creating and using object methods
- What JSON is and where it is used
- Differences between JavaScript objects and JSON
- Converting data using:
    - JSON.stringify()
    - JSON.parse()

This section focuses on data modeling fundamentals, which are critical for frontend, backend, and API-based development.

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file includes hands-on JavaScript problems such as:

- Creating an object with multiple properties
- Accessing object values using dot and bracket notation
- Updating object properties and adding new ones
- Adding methods inside objects and using this
- Converting a JavaScript object into JSON format
- Converting JSON data back into a JavaScript object

All programs are written in plain JavaScript, without using any frameworks or libraries.
