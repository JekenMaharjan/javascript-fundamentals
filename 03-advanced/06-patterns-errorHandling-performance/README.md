## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains:

- Common real-world JavaScript patterns and where to use them
- How to handle errors safely without crashing applications
- When to use `throw` versus logging errors
- Performance techniques like debounce and throttle
- Identifying and preventing memory leaks
- Handling multiple async operations using `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`

This section builds a professional mindset for writing production-ready JavaScript.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file demonstrates:

- Implementing Module, Factory, and Singleton patterns
- Using `try...catch...finally` for error handling
- Creating debounce and throttle utilities
- Optimizing DOM manipulation using `DocumentFragment`
- Preventing performance issues in scroll and input events
- Using `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()` for async control

All examples follow best practices used in real-world frontend applications.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Browser Environment (Recommended)

1. Create a basic HTML file
2. Add required DOM elements (`inputBox`, `ulParent`, etc.)
3. Link `test.js`
4. Open in a modern browser and check the console

### Option 2: Console Testing

- Non-DOM sections (patterns, promises, error handling)
can be tested directly in the browser console.

## 🎯 Learning Objective

After completing this exam, you should be able to:

- Write structured and maintainable JavaScript
- Apply design patterns where appropriate
- Handle runtime errors confidently
- Improve performance using debounce and throttle
- Prevent memory leaks
- Manage multiple promises efficiently

> These skills separate beginner coders from professional JavaScript developers.
