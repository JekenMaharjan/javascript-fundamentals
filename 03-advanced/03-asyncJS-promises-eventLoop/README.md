# JavaScript Exam – Advanced Level (Exam 3)

This folder contains **Advanced Level – Exam 3** of the JavaScript Exam series.

It focuses on **Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises, and the Event Loop**, which are essential for handling asynchronous operations, APIs, and real-world web application behavior.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Exam No**: 03  
- **Topic**: Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises & Event Loop  

This exam ensures you understand:

- How JavaScript handles **asynchronous operations**  
- Using **callbacks, promises, and async/await**  
- The **event loop mechanism**, microtasks, and macrotasks  
- Handling **errors in asynchronous code**  
- Using **closures in async scenarios**  

---

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

This exam covers:

1. Asynchronous JavaScript fundamentals  
2. Event Loop and its execution model  
3. Callback functions and “callback hell”  
4. Promises and their states  
5. `async`/`await` syntax for simpler async code  
6. Microtasks vs macrotasks  
7. Fetch API & error handling  
8. Closures in asynchronous programming

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains:

- What asynchronous JavaScript is and why it is needed
- How the event loop handles async callbacks without blocking
- Callbacks and the challenges of callback hell
- Creating and using Promises
- Using async/await to write readable async code
- Understanding microtasks vs macrotasks in the event loop
- Fetch API and handling errors effectively
- Using closures in asynchronous contexts (e.g., counters, intervals)

This section provides a deep understanding of async programming, which is critical for modern web development.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file includes hands-on exercises such as:

- Using setTimeout for delayed execution
- Converting nested callbacks to Promises
- Writing async/await functions with proper error handling
- Creating conditional Promises that resolve or reject
- Demonstrating microtask vs macrotask order
- Handling fetch errors in async functions
- Using closures to maintain state in asynchronous code

All programs are written in plain JavaScript, focusing on event-driven programming and async best practices.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Understand and implement asynchronous JavaScript effectively
- Avoid callback hell using Promises and async/await
- Master the event loop, microtasks, and macrotasks
- Handle errors in fetch and other async operations
- Use closures to maintain state across asynchronous calls

> Asynchronous programming is key to building performant, responsive, and modern web applications.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Move to Advanced Exam 4: Advanced Functions & Memory Optimization
- Practice combining async/await, closures, and event loop knowledge in real-world projects
- Maintain clean, readable, and modular async code
