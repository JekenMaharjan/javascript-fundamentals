# JavaScript Exam – Advanced Level (Exam 2)

This folder contains **Advanced Level – Exam 2** of the JavaScript Exam series.

It focuses on **Advanced Functions, Scope, and ES6 Features**, which are essential for writing clean, efficient, and modern JavaScript code.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Exam No**: 02  
- **Topic**: Advanced Functions, Scope & ES6 Features  

This exam ensures you understand:

- How to write **private and modular code** using IIFEs and closures  
- Differences between **function declarations and expressions**  
- Handling **scope and hoisting** effectively  
- Modern ES6 features like **modules, rest/spread operators, destructuring, and arrow functions**  
- Memory-efficient programming using **prototypes**

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

This exam covers:

1. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)  
2. Function declaration vs function expression  
3. Variable scope and hoisting (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
4. Shallow copy vs deep copy  
5. ES6 modules – export and import  
6. Prototypes and prototype methods  
7. Rest and Spread operators  
8. Destructuring assignment  
9. Arrow functions and their `this` behavior

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains:

- What IIFE is and why it is used for private scope
- Differences between function declarations and expressions
- Understanding scope and hoisting for `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Shallow vs deep copy of arrays and objects
- How ES6 modules allow modular code and code reuse
- Using prototypes for memory efficiency and inheritance
- Rest and Spread operators for flexible function arguments and array/object manipulation
- Destructuring assignment for arrays and objects
- Arrow functions and how `this` behaves differently than regular functions

This section strengthens your knowledge of modern JavaScript best practices, which are essential for building advanced web applications and preparing for interviews.

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file includes hands-on exercises such as:

- Writing IIFE to execute code immediately
- Converting function declarations to function expressions
- Creating shallow and deep copies of arrays and objects
- Implementing modules with export/import
- Adding methods to a prototype of a constructor function
- Using Rest operator to accept multiple arguments
- Using Spread operator to merge arrays
- Extracting values using destructuring

All exercises are written in plain JavaScript, focusing on concept clarity and ES6 features.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Write modular and efficient code using IIFE and closures
- Understand scope, hoisting, and lexical environment
- Apply ES6 features like modules, rest/spread, destructuring, and arrow functions
- Use prototypes to optimize memory usage
- Prepare for advanced coding interviews and real-world projects

> Mastering these concepts is key to writing clean, maintainable, and modern JavaScript.
