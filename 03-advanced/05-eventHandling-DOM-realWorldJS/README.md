## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Exam No**: 05  
- **Topic**: Event Handling, DOM Manipulation & Real-World JS  

This exam ensures you understand:

- The **Document Object Model (DOM)** and how JavaScript interacts with it  
- Selecting, modifying, and dynamically creating DOM elements  
- Handling events efficiently using **addEventListener** and **event delegation**  
- Understanding **event propagation** (bubbling & capturing)  
- Applying JavaScript in **real-world frontend scenarios** like forms, tabs, modals, and API data

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

This exam covers:

1. The **DOM** and its structure  
2. Selecting elements: `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`  
3. Adding events using **addEventListener**  
4. Difference between **inline, traditional, and modern event handling**  
5. Event **bubbling and capturing**  
6. Modifying DOM elements: content, HTML, style  
7. **Event delegation** for efficiency  
8. Real-world applications:
   - Form validation

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains:

- What the DOM is and how to interact with it
- How to select elements and modify their content or style
- The different ways to attach event listeners
- Event propagation: bubbling vs capturing
- Efficient event handling using delegation
- Real-world frontend applications where DOM and events are essential

This section provides a strong foundation for building interactive web pages using pure JavaScript.

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file includes exercises such as:

- Selecting DOM elements and modifying content, style, or structure
- Adding click and submit event listeners
- Implementing event delegation for dynamic elements
- Dynamically creating new DOM elements
- Performing form validation
- Using Fetch API to retrieve and display data
- Building tab navigation UI using DOM and event listeners

All programs use modern JavaScript techniques for real-world frontend development.
