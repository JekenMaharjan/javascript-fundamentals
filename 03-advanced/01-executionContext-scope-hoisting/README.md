# JavaScript Exam – Advanced Level (Exam 1)

This folder contains **Advanced Level – Exam 1** of the JavaScript Exam series.

This exam focuses on **Execution Context, Scope, and Hoisting**, which are core concepts that explain **how JavaScript executes code under the hood** and are essential for writing robust, bug-free applications.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Exam No**: 01  
- **Topic**: Execution Context, Scope & Hoisting  

This exam ensures you understand **variable lifecycles, scope rules, hoisting behavior, and the Temporal Dead Zone**, which are critical for debugging and advanced JavaScript programming.

---

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

This exam covers:

1. JavaScript Execution Context (Global & Function)  
2. The Call Stack and how JS uses it  
3. Variable hoisting (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
4. Function hoisting  
5. Scope types: Global, Function, Block  
6. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)  
7. Predicting outputs based on hoisting and scope rules

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The **theory.md** file explains:

- What an **Execution Context** is
- Differences between **Global Execution Context (GEC)** and **Function Execution Context (FEC)**
- How the Call Stack** works in JavaScript
- Variable and function **hoisting**, and differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Scope types and accessibility rules
- What the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is
- Predicting outputs for hoisted variables and functions

This section ensures **deep conceptual clarity**, which is crucial for advanced coding and interviews.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The **test.js** file includes exercises such as:

- Fixing hoisting issues to produce correct outputs
- Correcting block scope problems using `let` and `const`
- Implementing closures with private variables
- Demonstrating global vs local scope through practical examples

All examples are written in **plain JavaScript**, without frameworks or libraries.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Understand how JavaScript executes code step by step
- Learn variable lifecycles and hoisting rules
- Handle scope issues confidently
- Use closures effectively
- Avoid common bugs related to hoisting and TDZ

> Mastery of execution context and scope is the foundation for **advanced JS debugging and optimization**.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Move to Advanced Exam 2: Closures, Scope Chains & Advanced Functions
- Practice real-world debugging scenarios
- Combine knowledge of hoisting with asynchronous programming
- Maintain clean code and documentation for all exercises

📌 *This exam is part of a structured JavaScript learning roadmap, progressing from intermediate to advanced topics.*
