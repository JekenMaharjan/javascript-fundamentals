# JavaScript Exam – Advanced Level (Exam 4)

This folder contains **Advanced Level – Exam 4** of the JavaScript Exam series.

It focuses on **ES6+ features, Classes, Inheritance, and real-world design patterns**, which are essential for modern JavaScript development and object-oriented programming.

---

## 📘 Exam Overview

- **Level**: Advanced  
- **Exam No**: 04  
- **Topic**: ES6+, Classes & Inheritance  

This exam ensures you understand:

- JavaScript **classes and constructors**  
- **Inheritance** and method overriding  
- **Static methods**  
- ES6 features: modules, template literals, destructuring, default parameters, and spread operator  
- Real-world **design patterns**: Module, Factory, Singleton  

---

## 📚 Syllabus Covered

This exam covers:

1. Classes and constructor functions  
2. Class inheritance using `extends` and `super`  
3. Static methods in classes  
4. ES6 modules: `export` and `import`  
5. Template literals and default parameters  
6. Destructuring and spread operator  
7. Real-world JavaScript patterns:
   - Module pattern  
   - Factory pattern  
   - Singleton pattern

## 📝 Part A – Theory

The theory.md file explains:

- What classes are and how they differ from constructor functions
- How inheritance works in JavaScript
- Using static methods and ES6 module syntax
- Modern ES6+ features like template literals, default parameters, destructuring, and spread operators
- Implementing real-world patterns (Module, Factory, Singleton)

This section provides a strong foundation in object-oriented JavaScript and modern coding practices.

---

## 💻 Part B – Practical Test

The test.js file includes hands-on exercises such as:

- Creating and using classes with constructors and methods
- Implementing class inheritance
- Using static methods
- Applying default parameters and template literals
- Using destructuring and spread operators in arrays and objects
- Implementing factory functions and singleton pattern
- Practicing real-world object-oriented patterns

All programs are written in plain JavaScript with ES6+ syntax for modern development.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

Make sure Node.js is installed, then run:

```bash
node test.js
```

### Option 2: Using Browser Console

1. Open any browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Copy and paste the code from test.js

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The goal of this exam is to:

- Understand modern JavaScript classes and object-oriented principles
- Implement inheritance and method overriding effectively
- Use static methods and ES6 modules in projects
- Master template literals, default parameters, destructuring, and spread
- Apply real-world patterns for modular, reusable, and maintainable code

> Classes, inheritance, and patterns are essential for writing scalable and professional JavaScript applications.
